            <li>ReactJS is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building reusable UI components. It is an open-source, component-based front end library responsible only for the view layer of the application. It was created by Jordan Walke, who was a software engineer at Facebook. It was initially developed and maintained by Facebook and was later used in its products like WhatsApp & Instagram. Facebook developed ReactJS in 2011 in its newsfeed section, but it was released to the public in the month of May 2013.</li>

                Why learn ReactJS? Today, many JavaScript frameworks are available in the market(like angular, node), but still, React came into the market and gained popularity amongst them. The previous frameworks follow the traditional data flow structure, which uses the DOM (Document Object Model). DOM is an object which is created by the browser each time a web page is loaded. It dynamically adds or removes the data at the back end and when any modifications were done, then each time a new DOM is created for the same page. This repeated creation of DOM makes unnecessary memory wastage and reduces the performance of the application.

                <li>JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension)
      <code> "const myElement = <h1>I Love JSX!</h1>;
      
      const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
      root.render(myElement); "</code>
                </li><br>
                <li>Virtual DOM<br>
                <code>
      A virtual DOM is a lightweight JavaScript representation of the Document Object Model (DOM) used in declarative web frameworks such as React, Vue. js, and Elm. Updating the virtual DOM is comparatively faster than updating the actual DOM (via js).</code>
      <br>
      <code>
      In React, for every DOM object, there is a corresponding “virtual DOM object.” A virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object, like a lightweight copy. A virtual DOM object has the same properties as a real DOM object, but it lacks the real thing's power to directly change what's on the screen.</code></li> <br>

      }</code>
                  <code>class Welcome extends React.Component {
        render() {
          return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
        }

        <!-- Why React? -->
        <section id="Why_React?" class="main-section"><header>Why React?</header>
            <p>Now, the main question arises in front of us is why one should use React. There are so many open-source platforms for making the front-end web application development easier, like Angular.</p>
            <p>Let us take a quick look on the benefits of React over other competitive technologies or frameworks. With the front-end world-changing on a daily basis, it's hard to devote time to learning a new framework especially when that framework could ultimately become a dead end. So, if you're looking for the next best thing but you're feeling a little bit lost in the framework jungle, I suggest checking out React.</p>
            <p>ReactJS is just simpler to grasp right away. The component-based approach, well-defined lifecycle, and use of just plain JavaScript make React very simple to learn, build a professional web (and mobile applications), and support it. React uses a special syntax called JSX which allows you to mix HTML with JavaScript. This is not a requirement; Developer can still write in plain JavaScript but JSX is much easier to use.</p>
            <p> Anyone with a basic previous knowledge in programming can easily understand React while Angular and Ember are referred to as Domain-specific Language, implying that it is difficult to learn them. To react, you just need basic knowledge of CSS and HTML.</p>
