        <p>ReactJS is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building reusable UI components. It is an open-source, component-based front end library responsible only for the view layer of the application. It was created by Jordan Walke, who was a software engineer at Facebook. It was initially developed and maintained by Facebook and was later used in its products like WhatsApp & Instagram. Facebook developed ReactJS in 2011 in its newsfeed section, but it was released to the public in the month of May 2013.</p>
        <p>Why learn ReactJS? Today, many JavaScript frameworks are available in the market(like angular, node), but still, React came into the market and gained popularity amongst them. The previous frameworks follow the traditional data flow structure, which uses the DOM (Document Object Model). DOM is an object which is created by the browser each time a web page is loaded. It dynamically adds or removes the data at the back end and when any modifications were done, then each time a new DOM is created for the same page. This repeated creation of DOM makes unnecessary memory wastage and reduces the performance of the application.</p>

        <p>Currently, ReactJS gaining quick popularity as the best JavaScript framework among web developers. It is playing an essential role in the front-end ecosystem. The important features of ReactJS are as following.</p>
        <p><ul>
         <li>JSX (JavaScript XML)</li>
         <code>const one = <h1>Hello World!</h1>;</code>
         <li>Component</li>
         React components example
         <code>function Welcome(props) {
            return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
          }
          
          const element = <Welcome name="Faisal Arkan" />;
          ReactDOM.render(
            element,
            document.getElementById('root')
          );</code>

          Stateful class type components
          <code>class Cat extends React.Component {
            constructor(props) {
              super(props);
          
              this.state = {
                humor: 'happy'
              }
            }
            render() {
              return(
                <div>
                  <h1>{this.props.name}</h1>
                  <p>
                    {this.props.color}
                  </p>
                </div>
              );
            }
          }</code>

          Stateless Components
Functional Components (Arrow Function from ES6)
<code>const Cat = props => {
    return (  
      <div>
        <h1>{props.name}</h1>
        <p>{props.color}</p>
      </div>;
    );
  };</code>

  Implicit Return Components

  <code>const Cat = props => 
    <div>
      <h1>{props.name}</h1>
      <p>{props.color}</p>
    </div>;</code>

            <header>Why React?</header>
            Now, the main question arises in front of us is why one should use React. There are so many open-source platforms for making the front-end web application development easier, like Angular. Let us take a quick look on the benefits of React over other competitive technologies or frameworks. With the front-end world-changing on a daily basis, it's hard to devote time to learning a new framework especially when that framework could ultimately become a dead end. So, if you're looking for the next best thing but you're feeling a little bit lost in the framework jungle, I suggest checking out React.
            <ol>
                <li>Simplicity</li>
                ReactJS is just simpler to grasp right away. The component-based approach, well-defined lifecycle, and use of just plain JavaScript make React very simple to learn, build a professional web (and mobile applications), and support it. React uses a special syntax called JSX which allows you to mix HTML with JavaScript. This is not a requirement; Developer can still write in plain JavaScript but JSX is much easier to use.

                <li>Easy to learn</li>
                Anyone with a basic previous knowledge in programming can easily understand React while Angular and Ember are referred to as Domain-specific Language, implying that it is difficult to learn them. To react, you just need basic knowledge of CSS and HTML.

                <li>Native Approach</li>
                React can be used to create mobile applications (React Native). And React is a diehard fan of reusability, meaning extensive code reusability is supported. So at the same time, we can make IOS, Android and Web applications.

                <li>Data Binding</li>
                React uses one-way data binding and an application architecture called Flux controls the flow of data to components through one control point the dispatcher. It's easier to debug self-contained components of large ReactJS apps.

                <li>Performance</li>
                React does not offer any concept of a built-in container for dependency. You can use Browserify, Require JS, EcmaScript 6 modules which we can use via Babel, ReactJS-di to inject dependencies automatically.

                <li>Testability</li>
                ReactJS applications are super easy to test. React views can be treated as functions of the state, so we can manipulate with the state we pass to the ReactJS view and take a look at the output and triggered actions, events, functions, etc. 
            </ol>
